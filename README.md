this is the prototype version of my project.

there are alot off things that i orginaly wrote, that could inprove.
i am currently busy with inproving the code, the inproved code u can see at: https://github.com/KGT-projects/Java-university-project-WIP

the result of this code i want in my final code.
but this code is not effiecent, and it doesn't look good, there is way to much code, and to vind a specific line is quite hard.

the prototype wil be on my page till my WIP is done.
so u could still see the result i want in the end.

this code does work. and it does what it needs to do. and it works pretty well.
but there are alot of hickups and stuff that could inprove.
